## My Hobbies

**Flying**
- I enjoy flying. I have been flying out of the womb since I was a wee lad. No one else can fly so I must be quite adept.

**Sword Fighting**
- I fight with swords in my sleep. I have not fought anyone in real life but I haven't seen anyone fight in real life so I must be the best.

**Cat**
- This one may not be a hobby but I enjoy petting my cat. He is the best in the world.
